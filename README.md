# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to showcase my capabilities in python. The project 
first uses the CityBikes API with a chosen location (Denver, CO) to highlight the available bikes. Afterwards, we will use Foursquare API and Yelp API to retrieve number of restaurants from each bike station in Denver. We will compare the data between Foursquare and Yelp results. You will visualize the data then conduct regression model.

## Process
Part 1 - CityBikes API
Choose a city and query bike stations from CityBikes API
Determine the latitude, longitude and bikes available
Parson JSON into Panda dataframe

Part 2 - Foursquare and Yelp
Connect Foursquare API and Yelp API
Using the bike station data from Part 1, query with each API
Create a dataframe for Foursquare results and Yelp results
Compare the data from both Foursquare results and Yelp results

Part 3 - Joing Data
Join the data from Part 1 and Part 2 into a new dataframe
Use data visualization to showcase the data
Create a SQLLite database and store data

Part 4 - Building Model
Build a regression model
Interpret results

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
Foursquare and Yelp are hard to yield results due to limitation
Depending on the density of the city, more data to process and filter.
Figuring out how to debug my codes so they can run.

## Future Goals
Running more tests to ensure I'm yielding expected results and to debug codes.
Develop a style guide for consistency.
Documenting my process to understand the to do's and not to do's for future projects.
